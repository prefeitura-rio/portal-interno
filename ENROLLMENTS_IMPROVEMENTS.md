# Enrollments System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the enrollments system, including better type safety, API integration, and enhanced functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Type Safety

#### New Types Added (`src/types/course.ts`):
- `EnrollmentStatus`: Union type for enrollment statuses (`'confirmed' | 'pending' | 'cancelled' | 'waitlist'`)
- `Enrollment`: Complete interface for enrollment data
- `EnrollmentSummary`: Interface for enrollment statistics
- `EnrollmentFilters`: Interface for filtering options
- `EnrollmentStatusConfig`: Interface for status display configuration
- `EnrollmentAction`: Interface for tracking enrollment actions
- `EnrollmentResponse`: Interface for API responses
- `EnrollmentUpdateRequest`: Interface for update operations
- `EnrollmentCreateRequest`: Interface for creation operations

### 2. Mock Data System (`src/lib/mock-enrollments.ts`)

#### Features:
- Comprehensive mock data for multiple courses (courses 1-5)
- Realistic enrollment scenarios with different statuses
- Helper functions for data manipulation:
  - `calculateEnrollmentSummary()`: Calculate enrollment statistics
  - `getEnrollmentsForCourse()`: Get enrollments with pagination and filtering
  - `updateEnrollmentStatus()`: Update enrollment status
  - `addEnrollment()`: Add new enrollments

#### Mock Data Includes:
- 19 total enrollments across 5 courses
- Various enrollment statuses (confirmed, pending, cancelled, waitlist)
- Realistic Brazilian names, CPFs, and contact information
- Notes and timestamps for tracking

### 3. API Route (`src/app/api/enrollments/[course-id]/route.ts`)

#### Endpoints:
- `GET /api/enrollments/[course-id]`: Fetch enrollments with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/enrollments/[course-id]`: Create new enrollment
- `PATCH /api/enrollments/[course-id]?enrollmentId=...`: Update enrollment status

#### Query Parameters Supported:
- `page`: Page number for pagination
- `perPage`: Items per page
- `status`: Filter by status (comma-separated)
- `search`: Search in candidate name, email, or CPF
- `dateStart`/`dateEnd`: Filter by enrollment date range
- `ageMin`/`ageMax`: Filter by age range

### 4. Custom Hook (`src/hooks/use-enrollments.ts`)

#### Features:
- `useEnrollments()`: Custom hook for managing enrollment data
- Automatic data fetching with course ID
- Support for pagination and filtering
- Real-time status updates
- Error handling and loading states

#### Hook Interface:
```typescript
interface UseEnrollmentsOptions {
  courseId: string
  page?: number
  perPage?: number
  filters?: EnrollmentFilters
  autoFetch?: boolean
}
```

### 5. Updated Enrollments Table Component

#### Improvements:
- Removed hardcoded mock data
- Integrated with new API and types
- Added loading and error states
- Enhanced status display with icons
- Added waitlist status support
- Improved summary cards with real data
- Added notes display in enrollment details
- Real-time status updates

#### New Features:
- Loading spinner during data fetch
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Enhanced status badges with icons
- Support for enrollment notes
- Real-time enrollment status updates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```typescript
// In a component
const { enrollments, summary, loading, error } = useEnrollments({
  courseId: '1',
  page: 1,
  perPage: 10
})
```

### With Filters:
```typescript
const { enrollments } = useEnrollments({
  courseId: '1',
  filters: {
    status: ['confirmed', 'pending'],
    search: 'Jo√£o',
    dateRange: {
      start: new Date('2025-01-01'),
      end: new Date('2025-01-31')
    }
  }
})
```

### API Calls:
```typescript
// Fetch enrollments
GET /api/enrollments/1?page=1&perPage=10&status=confirmed,pending

// Update enrollment status
PATCH /api/enrollments/1?enrollmentId=123
{
  "status": "confirmed",
  "notes": "Documents verified"
}
```

## Data Structure

### Enrollment Object:
```typescript
{
  id: string
  courseId: string
  candidateName: string
  cpf: string
  email: string
  age: number
  phone: string
  enrollmentDate: string
  status: 'confirmed' | 'pending' | 'cancelled' | 'waitlist'
  notes?: string
  customFields?: Record<string, string>
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
}
```

### Summary Object:
```typescript
{
  totalVacancies: number
  confirmedCount: number
  pendingCount: number
  cancelledCount: number
  waitlistCount: number
  remainingVacancies: number
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces
2. **Scalability**: Modular design that can easily integrate with real APIs
3. **User Experience**: Loading states, error handling, and real-time updates
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns with custom hooks
5. **Flexibility**: Support for filtering, pagination, and custom fields
6. **Realism**: Comprehensive mock data that reflects real-world scenarios

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real backend APIs
- Real-time notifications for enrollment updates
- Export functionality for enrollment lists
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Bulk enrollment operations
- Email notifications for status changes
